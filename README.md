### Description

This is Neovim clipboard provider. See `:h g:clipboard` for more info.

### Usage

Currently only MS Windows(R) is supported. So _neoclip_ serves as a replacement for
_win32yank.exe_.

A pre-built version of _neoclip_w32.dll_ is already available under _lua/_ subdirectory.
To rebuild it from source you'll need Lua development package.
