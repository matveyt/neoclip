*neoclip.txt*	Neovim clipboard provider

==============================================================================
OVERVIEW                                                             *neoclip*

|Neoclip| is a clipboard provider for Neovim |provider-clipboard|. It allows
to access system clipboard without any external tools, such as `win32yank`,
`xclip`, `xsel`, `pbcopy`, `pbpaste` etc.

Supported platforms are Windows, macOS and *nix (with X11 or Wayland).

==============================================================================
BUILDING                                                         *neoclip-build*

|Neoclip| has to be built from source. So you'll need C (Objective C for
macOS) compiler and tools installed on your machine.

You'll also need a project build tool. Both CMake https://cmake.org and
Meson https://mesonbuild.com will do.

The common build pre-requisite for all platforms is LuaJIT https://luajit.org.
This is because we're going to make a Lua binary extension module for Neovim's
builtin engine. The exact package name and installation method depends on your
OS/distro. For example, on Debian GNU/Linux it could be >

    $sudo apt install libluajit-5.1-dev

Hopefully, it's enough for both Windows and macOS. But on *nix we need also
threads, X11 and Wayland client libraries. Some of them may already be
installed, while some are not. An example suitable for Debian GNU/Linux >

    $sudo apt install libx11-dev libwayland-dev

And the final point. CMake doesn't support Wayland libraries out-of-the-box.
So building the project with CMake may require installing ECM (aka Extra CMake
Modules) package as well. Otherwise neoclip/Wayland module could be quietly
skipped. >

    $sudo apt install extra-cmake-modules

So finally we should be able to build our project (this is for CMake with
Ninja as a backend): >

    $ cd ~/.config/nvim/pack/bundle/opt/neoclip/src
    $ cmake -B build -G Ninja && ninja -C build install/strip
>
Now run Neovim and do |:checkhealth| to see if clipboard tool has been set up
properly.

ISSUES                                                          *neoclip-issues*

neoclip/Wayland module requires wlr-data-control protocol
https://wayland.app/protocols/wlr-data-control-unstable-v1. If your Wayland
compositor does not provide it (e.g. GNOME/Mutter) then neoclip/X11 will be
tried instead.
